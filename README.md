## About Pomorodo
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

### The technique has six steps:

* Decide on the task to be done.
* Set the Pomodoro timer (25 minutes).
* Work on the task.
* End work when the timer rings and take a short break (5 minutes).
* Go back to Step 2 and repeat until you complete four pomodori.
* After four pomodori are done, take a long break (20 minutes) instead of a short break. Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.
